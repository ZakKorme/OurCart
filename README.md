# OurCart

The following application was designed and built for individuals and families to track their grocery lists and pantry items. The application also provides the ability to generate recipe ideas based on items stored in the pantry. 


## How to run

```
cd app
npm start
```

## Motivation

The motivation behind this application was to help families track grocery lists synchronously and stay up-to-date with pantry items. The List page provides the ability to share and add items synchronously across different devices. After items have been purchased from the grocery list they will be added into the panty and can be used to generate recipe ideas. 

Grocery lists will also be stored and users will be able to reference the lists at a later date.
